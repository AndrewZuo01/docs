📦 OpenIMSDK 
- Embedded directly into applications as a library.

🖥️ OpenIMServer 
- Deployed as an independent server-side program.

> 📢 **Note**: OpenIMSDK does not integrate a UI interface, and OpenIMServer does not provide user registration and login functions, meaning it's not a complete IM product.
