# OpenIMServer APIs

## 🚀 REST API

OpenIMServer offers a **REST API** for business systems to use, enhancing their functionalities. Examples include:

- 🛠 Creating groups
- 📬 Sending push notifications

For more features, refer to the subsequent API documentation.

> ⚠️ **Note**: When invoking the **REST API**, you must do so as an **APP Administrator**. This service is provided through port `10002`. An **APP Administrator** refers to users with super privileges. OpenIMServer has three built-in users of this type, their `userID` are as follows:
> - `openIM123456`
> - `openIM654321`
> - `openIMAdmin`

Before starting to call the API, you first need to obtain the APP Administrator's token by [getting the token](./apis/authenticationManagement/getUserToken) using a secret. Moreover, the [user registration](./apis/userManagement/userRegister) interface also requires the use of a secret.

## 🔗 Webhooks

OpenIMServer also offers a robust callback feature to meet a broader range of business needs. The concept of **callbacks** is that before or after certain events take place, OpenIMServer will send a request to the business server. These events include, but are not limited to:

- 📤 Callback before sending a message
- 📥 Callback after sending a message
