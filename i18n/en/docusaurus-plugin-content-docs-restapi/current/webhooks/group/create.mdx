# Callback Before Group Creation

## Function Description

The App business server can obtain requests for user group creation through this callback. At the same time, the business server can reject a user's request to create a group or make modifications and interventions to the request.

## Points to Note

- To enable callbacks, you must configure the callback URL and turn on the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. See the [Callback Instructions](../introduction) document for configuration methods.
- The direction of the callback is from OpenIMServer initiating an HTTP/HTTPS POST request to the App backend.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That Might Trigger This Callback

- App users create a group through the client.
- App administrators create a group via the REST API.

## Timing of Callback

- Before OpenIMServer is preparing to create a group.

## Interface Description

### Request URL Example

In the following example, the callback URL configured by the App is `https://callbackurl`.

```plaintext
https://callbackurl?command=$CallbackCommand
```
