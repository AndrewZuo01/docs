## ðŸš€ Using the Demo
We strongly recommend that you start by running the framework-specific example [DEMO](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-PC-Web-Demo) we have prepared for you. This not only allows you to experience the features of OpenIMSDK firsthand, but it also helps you quickly identify and address any issues during the actual integration process.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Add Dependency

> The official plugin has been uploaded to the [dcloud plugin market](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/plugin?id=6577).

- Select the corresponding project and package name to import the SDK.

![uni_import](./assets/uni_import.png)

- Open the `manifest.json` file located in the SDK imported project's root directory, select **App Native Plugin Configuration**, and import the cloud plugin.

![uni_import_manifest](./assets/uni_import_manifest.png)

- Download the npm package to simplify the SDK's import and use and encapsulate the API in Promise format.

```bash
npm install openim-uniapp-polyfill
```

### 2. Introduce in the Project

```js
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

const userID = '';
const token = '';
IMSDK.asyncApi(IMSDK.IMMethods.Login, IMSDK.uuid(), userID, token)
  .then(() => {
    // Login successful
  })
  .catch(() => {
    // Login failed
  });

const onConnectSuccess = () => {
  // Connection successful
};
// Set listener
IMSDK.subscribe(IMSDK.IMEvents.OnConnectSuccess, onConnectSuccess);
// Unsubscribe listener
IMSDK.unsubscribe(IMSDK.IMEvents.OnConnectSuccess, onConnectSuccess);
```

### 3. Cloud Pack Custom Debug Base

> Note: The package name needs to be consistent with the package name set when importing the cloud plugin in the first step.
